				<p>Our Vision</p>
				<p class ="par">We are a collaborative group dedicated to the application of innovative digital technologies and methods to low-cost, expeditious, multi-media publication of primary source texts, and appropriate related annotations and background materials. The Newbook is a fundamental departure from traditional print publication. The Newbook exists in many forms at the same time, including web displays such as side-by-side transcription and translation, transcription with direct access to images of the original text and/or annotation, e-reader and e-pub versions of the texts, updatable print on demand "old book" style versions, and a marked up base text suitable for digital analysis. For projects in which new information is being regularly added, all versions can be auto-regenerated in real time to reflect the most up-to-date text.</p>

				<p>Student Interns</p>

				<p class = "par">We are also committed to training undergraduates in digital humanities and digital technologies, encouraging them to see the relationship between digital technologies and traditional, scholarly research. We have found that our interns are self-selecting and self-starting; we provide them with basic training in digital tools and technologies, then give them autonomy to contribute on an equal basis. On the Svoboda Diaries, for example, they work in overlapping groups, including teams for technology, transcription, editing, web design, historical research, and translation. </p>

				<p>Fostering Digital Humanities</p>

				<p class = "par">Both directors and interns participate in Digital Humanities training, locally and internationally, forming connections with other DH projects and institutions that support them. In the past year they participated in conferences and workshops, including Demystifying Digital Humanities, sponsored by the Simpson Center at the University of Washington, Digital Humanities Summer Institute, at the University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C., and The Women Writers Project at Brown University. Interns have presented papers on both the Newbook Digital Texts in the Humanities and Svoboda Diaries at the University of Washington Undergraduate Research Symposium, Near Eastern Languages and Civilization Brown Bag lecture series, and the UW Undergraduate Research Symposium. </p>
