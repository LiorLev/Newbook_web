				<p>Our People</p>
				<p class ="par">Newbook Digital Texts in the Humanities was founded in 2012, by Walter Andrews, at the University of Washington. It has come to include a group of scholars who envision easy, open access to less well known literary and historical texts, and like works in the humanities and social sciences that might not otherwise be published by conventional academic presses.</p>
